# Shadcn UI already initialized

This project uses Shadcn UI for all UI elements, and an existing
[components.json](mdc:components.json) confirms it is already initialized. Do
**not** rerun `npx shadcn@latest init` unless you intentionally remove that file
and want to start over. If Shadcn UI is missing in a fresh clone, run `npx
shadcn@latest init` from the repository root to reinitialize it.

## Installed Components

The following Shadcn UI components are already installed and available:

- **Button**: The button component is installed at [src/components/ui/button.tsx](mdc:src/components/ui/button.tsx). Import it using `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`.
